# My DIY Projects Blog

This repository hosts my personal blog for DIY projects, featuring creations in 3D printing and woodworking. I document projects inspired by online designs and customized to meet specific needs, using tools and techniques I've learned as both a hobbyist and a data engineer.

The blog is built with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Features
